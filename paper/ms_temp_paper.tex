\section{Introduction}
Solar jets permeate the solar atmosphere, from spicules low in the chromosphere to macropsicules passing through the transition region and X-Ray jets extending into the solar corona. Investigations into these phenomena have advanced significantly with recent developments in solar telescopes such as Hinode and the Solar Dynamic Observatory. 


\section{Observation}
We observed a jet like feature at the limb on $21st$ June 2016 beginning at $07:30:00$ in CRISP, an instrument installed on the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) during a period of good seeing. %cite scharmer et al 2003
We used the H$\alpha$ filter, core line $656.28$ nm with $35$ slit increments from the core covering a $.32$ nm range, $-0.2$ and $+0.12$, and were further processed using te Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MOMBFD cite). % van Noort et al. 2005
The observations were of active region AR 11506 with $xc = 893, yc = -250$ in heliocentric coordinates on $930x930$ pixel images, with spatial resolution on $0.012$ arcsec/pixel and temporal resolution on $7.5$ sec.
