\section{Introduction}
Solar jets of various forms are ubiquitous the solar atmosphere, from spicules low in the chromosphere to macropsicules passing through the transition region and X-Ray jets extending into the solar corona. 
Investigations into these phenomena have advanced significantly with recent developments in solar telescopes such as Hinode and the Solar Dynamic Observatory.
These features are observed in a range of wavelengths and heights in the atmosphere. 

Low in the chromosphere a predominant feature is the spicule, these small scale jets, generally forming at the inter-granular lanes and reaching heights of $1$ - $5$ Mm.
They are also very short lived with a maximum lifetime of ~$5$ mins.
More importantly there is currently debate as to whether the population of spicules is divided into two forms, Type-1 and Type-2. 
Type-1 are described as longer lived and less explosive with respect to velocity, whereas Type-2 reach higher velocities and higher into the atmosphere, however are not observed to fall back down \cite{DePontieu2007}.

\section{Observation}
We observed a jet like feature at the limb on $21st$ June 2016 beginning at $07:30:00$ in CRISP, an instrument installed on the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) during a period of good seeing. %cite scharmer et al 2003
We used the H$\alpha$ filter, core line $656.28$ nm with $35$ slit increments from the core covering a $.32$ nm range, $-0.2$ and $+0.12$, and were further processed using te Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MOMBFD cite).
The observations were of active region AR 11506 with $xc = 893, yc = -250$ in heliocentric coordinates on $930x930$ pixel images, with spatial resolution on $0.012$ arcsec/pixel and temporal resolution on $7.5$ sec.
Due to the constant surveillance we currently have the Sun under, we also have simultaneous observations with the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO).

Using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), we observe the jet in most of the wavelengths available, $30.4$, $35.5$, $211$, $17.1$ and $13.1$ nm.
AIA on-board SDO \cite{AIAspec} provides $4096 \times 4096$ pixel images with a spatial resolution of $0.6$ arcsec per pixel and a cadence of $12$ sec.

Lastly, we also have observations in STEREO using the Heliospheric Imager \citep{Defise2001}. 
We are fortunate that when these observations were taken, STEREO A was at approximately $90^\circ$ to the Sun-Earth line, as such we also have observations of this feature as an on-disk feature.
In this case we are using the $30.4$ nm HI instrument, however, the distance from the Earth has now reached a point that the temporal cadence has reduced to $10$ min.
While this is possibly too high to undertake a detailed examination, we can certainly utilise this method to inform us as to the global behaviour of the macrospicule.
As we have a suite of observing instruments to utilise we aim to build a comprehensive description of this feature and how it may affect the environment around it.



\section{Results & Discussion}

\subsection{Time Distance Evolution}
Let us begin with the evolution of the jet-like feature over time. 
We have utilised a self-built, manual feature measuring tool, which, uses a clicking mechanism to select the foot and tip of the macrospicule, calculates the half weight and uses this as a guide to measure the width of the feature.
Using this tool on each frame, and therefore the time cadence of the instrument, we obtain the evolution of the jet and general ballistic information.
We have used this tool on each wavelength to examine the extent upwards through the corona. 
Observations in SDO record the entire lifetime of the feature, however the same is not true for observations using the SST, where the observation window in SST closes at $07:48:00$.
